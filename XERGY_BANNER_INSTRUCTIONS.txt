XERGY BANNER IMAGE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Facebook-Style Banner Background
---------------------------------

The login page now features a wide banner background behind the title, similar to Facebook cover photos.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Automatically detects "xergy_banner.png" in the Desktop folder
- If image exists: Uses it as background at 50% opacity
- If no image: Uses purple gradient fallback (looks great!)
- Banner is 1200px wide × 180px tall (responsive on mobile)
- Only appears on LOGIN PAGE (not on dashboard pages)

TO ADD YOUR CUSTOM BANNER IMAGE:
1. Create or find a professional banner image
2. Recommended size: 1200px × 300px (wide aspect ratio)
3. Save as: xergy_banner.png
4. Place in: C:\Users\marku\Desktop\
5. Restart the app to see your custom banner

IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: PNG or JPG (PNG recommended for transparency)
- Dimensions: 1200×300px ideal (minimum 800×200px)
- Content: Professional imagery, abstract patterns, or corporate branding
- Colors: Should complement the XERGY purple theme (#667eea to #764ba2)

DESIGN TIPS:
- Keep important content in the center (text will overlay)
- Avoid busy patterns that might reduce title readability
- Test at 50% opacity to ensure text is visible
- Consider using brand colors or abstract geometric patterns

CURRENT SETUP:
- 3D Glowing Logo: Top-right corner (all pages)
- Background Watermark Logo: Center (5% opacity, login only)
- Banner Background: Behind title (50% opacity, login only)

All visual elements work together for a professional, eye-catching login experience!
